- Discretizatisation of states - Clement, Darren
- returnIndexState() - Denzyl
- selectAction() - Clement
- simulateEpisodes() - Darren, Denzyl, Clement

#### Task 1: Development of RL Agent
- Sampling of random state from the CartPole Environment - Darren

#### Task 2: Demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL agent
- Running 100 episodes of the RL agent - Denzyl
